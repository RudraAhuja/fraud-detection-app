Fraud Detection System

Overview:
The Fraud Detection System is an internet based system that assists users in detecting the possible digital fraud messages and comprehending them instantly. Users are able to paste suspicious WhatsApp messages, SMS, and email text and have a risk of the fraud evaluated instantly, with further information and safety instructions given.
This system has a rule-driven detection and machine learning (ML)-driven NLP analysis to offer explainable and accurate fraud detection.

Problem Statement:
Due to the fast development of digital transactions and online communication, it is obsidian that fraud messages in the form of a bank, delivery service, or government agency appear. Most users are not able to identify real and fake messages instantly.

This system provides:
1. Real-time fraud detection
2. Risk scoring
3. Scam classification
4. Explainable results
5. Safety recommendations

Features:
1. Instant message fraud detection.
2. Pattern and keyword detection is based on rules.
3. Prediction of NLP-based scams.
4. Combined risk scoring engine.
5. Types of fraud (OTP scam, phishing, banking scam, et cetera)
6. Distrustful highlighting of keywords.
7. User safety measures.
8. Message logging and storage
9. Interactive and clean web interface.

System Architecture:
  Rule-based Detection Engine
→ NLP/ML Scam Probability Model
→ Combined Risk Score (Workflow Manager)
→ Fraud Classification
→ Explanation & Safety Advice
→ Message Logging

Technologies Used
 Python (Flask)
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Scikit-learn (NLP & ML model)
 TF-IDF Vectorizer
 Logistic Regression
 JSON (for message logging)
 Render (deployment)

How It Works

1. Entry of the suspicious message by the user.
2. Fraud indicator checks in the form of a rule-based engine.
3. NLP model computes the probability of a scam.
4. The two scores are then actually summed up and used as a composite risk score.
5. System shows the risk level, kind of fraud, description, and precautionary measures.
6. Message is recorded in anticipation of analysis.

Future Improvements:
→ Multilingual fraud detection 
→ Voice-based fraud detection
→ Image/screen shot fraud detection.
→ REAL-Time integration with telecommunication companies.
→ High-tech deep neural networks.

Conclusion:
This project can be seen as an illustrative and comprehensible method of digital fraud detection with the help of a hybrid machine learning and rules-based system. It tries to increase the awareness of users and avoid the possibility of digital fraud through real-time guidance and risk assessment.
